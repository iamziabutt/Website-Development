<h1>Exercise:</h1>
<p>Regular physical activity serves as a fundamental pillar of human health, acting as a powerful preventative measure against chronic conditions such as heart disease, hypertension, and Type 2 diabetes.  When you exercise, <mark>your body undergoes a complex series of beneficial biological shifts</mark> : your heart becomes a more efficient pump, your muscles improve their ability to utilize glucose, and your bones increase in density to support your frame. Beyond the physical, the neurological impact is equally significant; movement triggers the release of endorphins and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which collectively sharpen cognitive function, stabilize mood, and reduce the physiological markers of stress. Ultimately, maintaining a consistent routine isn't just about athletic performance or aesthetics—it is about preserving your metabolic health and ensuring a higher quality of life and independence as you age.</i>
