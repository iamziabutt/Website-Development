            <h2>Facts about dogs:</h2>
            <p>Dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) are incredible animals with senses far beyond our own, including a sense of smell that can be up to 100,000 times more powerful than a human's. Beyond their legendary noses, they possess 18 muscles to tilt and rotate each ear, allowing them to hear frequencies twice as high as we can. They don't sweat like humans; instead, they cool down by panting and releasing heat through their paw pads. Remarkably, every dog has a unique nose print, similar to a human fingerprint. These intelligent creatures are as smart as a two-year-old child and can even sense the Earth's magnetic field to align themselves while going to the bathroom.</p>

        <Aside>
           <p>Often hailed as "man's best friend," dogs are loyal, highly intelligent mammals that have lived alongside humans for over 15,000 years.</p>
